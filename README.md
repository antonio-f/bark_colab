# Bark Test


Bark is a text-to-audio model created by Suno. Bark can generate highly realistic, multilingual speech as well as other audio - including music, background noise and simple sound effects. The model can also produce nonverbal communications like laughing, sighing and crying. 


You can run the notebook on Colab if no GPUs are available.
